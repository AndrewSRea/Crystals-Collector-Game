        <h1>Crystals Collector!</h1>
        <p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific
            amount of points to your total score.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the
            game if your total score goes above the random number.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click the crystal.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Each time the game starts, the game will change the random number and the values
            of each crystal.</p>
